TODO: Create spritesheets for backgrounds - see tiles_bg.png

Other tiles will be added and given ingame behavior after basic functionality is out of the way.

We can observe sprite usage and behavior, among other things, with an emulator and legally acquired Super Mario World ROM.
Providing these in the project would likely not bring good things as far as the law goes (to put it lightly).
