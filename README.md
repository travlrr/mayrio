# Mayrio
Project #1 for Computer Science III.

Mayrio is a Super Mario World-style game built with Justin May's <b>Mayflower</b> framework.
The documentation for Mayflower can be found [here](http://mayflower.docs.ga/).

This project is very under-featured and buggy, and likely won't be seeing future improvement. Should changes be made, they'll probably be in an entirely new codebase.
